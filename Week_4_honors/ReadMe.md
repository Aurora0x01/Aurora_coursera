# Binary Tree Creation and Inorder Traversal

## Overview:
This C program reads a file containing integer pairs into an array. The first integer in the file indicates the size of the array, and the subsequent integers are read into the array. The program then constructs a binary tree using the array values and performs an inorder traversal, printing the values to the screen.

## Files:
- `main.c`: Contains the main C code for reading the file, creating a binary tree, and performing inorder traversal.
- `input.txt`: Sample input file with integer pairs. The first integer represents the array size.

## Compilation:
Compile the code using a C compiler. For example:
```bash
gcc main.c -o BinaryTreeTraversal
